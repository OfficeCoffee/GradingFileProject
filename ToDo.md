# Features to Implement:
- Open up the zipfiles that the students created (maybe using the unzipper function?)

- Handle multiple submissions by checking the time of submission

- Determine whether old submissions should be discarded or separated (either we delete them or we could put them into two folders: older submissions & most recent submissions)

- Find their driver class and either rename their class to the student name or delete the "public" keyword
